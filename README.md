# Crossstitch instruction generator

The goal here is to make a simple page that generates crosstitching instrutions for a pixel image. The user should be able to drag an image to the page, and then get instructions on which colors to use, how many times...

# State so far

Drag-and-drop works and gets the image, so that's nice. 
The instuction generation also does its job.

# Roadmap

 * Rendering the instructions in-page
 * Perhaps some kind of palette-choice feature, because rgb colors are prolly not helpful
 * being able to print the instructions? 
 * progress ticks?

...and definitely user testing :)
